# ESP32-Firebase-Sensor
This project uses an ESP32 microcontroller to read environmental data from DHT11 (temperature and humidity) and MQ135 (air quality) sensors. The collected data is then transmitted over Wi-Fi and stored in a Google Firebase Firestore database, allowing for real-time monitoring and data logging.
